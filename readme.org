* magit "standalone version"
[[http://magit.vc/][Magit]] is a great fantastic git frontend for emacs. Altough it is an
important part of my emacs workflow, I sometimes work in gitrepository
on the naked commandline. Up until now I resolved to tig to get a fast
and feature-rich text ui for simple commits, ammends, diffs when pure
git was not right for me.

This is a minimal emacs configuration that mimics tig but with the
magit implementation.

** Installation
clone the repository to ~/.magit and make an alias that calls
=emacs -q --load ~/.magit/init.el=.
